/* Although the extension has been installed, it has no instruction. Introduce a background script by creating a file titled background.jsand placing it inside the extension directory.
Background scripts and many other components must be registered in the manifest. Registering a background script in the manifest tells the extension which files to reference, and how that file will behave. */
